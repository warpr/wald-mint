wald:mint - A library for minting identifiers
=============================================

wald:mint is used to generate
[URIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) for entities and unique
[blank nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blank_node) for resources which don't need a
real identifier.

Entities
--------

An entity in wald:meta is a resource for which you need user friendly identifiers.  For
example if you're modeling a music library you might want entities for Artists, Songs,
Albums or Releases, etc..
